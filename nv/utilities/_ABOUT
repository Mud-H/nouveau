This folder contains classes that are included as a convenience. This is not intended to be a full library, but these
classes are intended to provide "basic" functionality that is not included in WordPress (or PHP) by default.

Html.php
Provides a very simple, straightforward way to generate HTML elements based on arrays. This extends HtmlBase() which
provides most of the most basic functionality.

HtmlBase.php
Provides the basic functionality for parsing arrays into HTML elements.

NV_Requirements.php
Checks the current PHP and WordPress version to ensure they are compatible with NOUVEAU. By default, this is loaded
before NOUVEAU loads any of the PHP 5.3 classes to prevent errors that are not helpful to normal users.

Php.php
Provides some helpful methods that useful for working with regular PHP. Currently, this is predominantly methods that
aid in array manipulation.

Theme.php
This class provides methods that are meant to be used directly in theme templates. This is still fairly preliminary.

WordPress.php
This class provides methods that provide additional WordPress functionality that is not (but probably should be)
included in core.

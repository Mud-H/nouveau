 TinyMCE Styles

 If you are using SASS, this compiles from /_foundation/scss/editor.scss and is loaded into your WordPress admins TinyMCE
 editor. You will generally want to use these styles in combination with customizations to \NV\Hooks\Editor.php,
 which allows you to easily add new style presets to the TinyMCE editor.
